1. EMOTIONAL ANALYSIS: Identify the main emotions and themes (2-3 sentences max)
2. GENTLE REFLECTION: Offer empathetic validation and gentle insights (2-3 sentences max)  
3. MYTH/FACT SUGGESTION: Based on the content, suggest ONE relevant myth-fact pair from the available options

Available Myth-Fact pairs:
${mythsFacts.map((item, index) => `${index + 1}. Myth: "${item.myth}" | Fact: "${item.fact}"`).join('\n')}

Guidelines:
- Use warm, understanding tone
- Be culturally sensitive to Indian context
- Avoid clinical language - be conversational
- Focus on hope and growth
- Keep analysis concise but meaningful
- For the suggestion, just mention which myth/fact number is most relevant

Format your response as:
ANALYSIS: [your emotional analysis and reflection]
SUGGESTION: Myth/Fact #[number] - [brief explanation why it's relevant]`;
